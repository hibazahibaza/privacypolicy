Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting your personal and health-related information..</p>
   

   
  <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p><em>This app may access the following data locally on your device:

Body/Skin Temperature (from built-in watch sensors)

We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal or health-related data to our servers or any third parties. All sensor data remains on your watch and is used only to display temperature in real time.

</p> 

  <h2>2. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p> We do not share your data with any third parties. The app does not use advertising networks, analytics services, or cloud-based features.
    Since we do not collect or transmit data, no server-side storage is involved. However, we ensure that the app uses system permissions responsibly and respects all user privacy settings.</p>

   <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app requests access only to:

Body Sensors – used exclusively for reading temperature from your smartwatch.

We do not access any other sensitive data like location, contacts, or microphone.

   <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We do not collect any personal data, so there are no specific security measures needed for storing or processing data. Since no personal information is handled, there is no risk of exposure.</p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p><em>Body Temperature</em> does not target children under the age of 13, nor do we knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will take steps to delete that information as soon as possible.</p>

   <h2>6. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy. Please review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information.</p>
